I want the following headings in the services section. The headings should be left-aligned on the page. Each heading should be in a vertical line, with the same text animation as the hamburger menu headings. When you hover over each heading, I want the text that proceeds it to appear on the right side of the page as if being typed out. When you hover over another heading, I want the old text to be backspaced quickly, and then the new text is typed out.
