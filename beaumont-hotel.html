        <h1>The Beaumont Hotel</h1>
        <p>Carbonem was commissioned by long-standing collaborators AU Music Productions to design and program a complete Q-SYS control system for The Beaumont Hotel (formerly Birdees) following a major renovation that added an entirely new floor to the venue.

          The updated space includes a rooftop bar with a swimming pool, an interior dining area, a club level, and a pool room. We developed a robust AV control solution encompassing four audio zones—each with three to six sub-zones—and full microphone control across the entire venue.
          
          Our scope also included integrating control for a Blackmagic Videohub 20x20 to enable seamless SDI video switching and configuring a Novastar MX30 for dynamic LED screen layout control. Both systems were programmed using custom Lua scripting to ensure deep integration and reliable performance.
          
          The final system offers intuitive control via multiple venue tablets, with remote access for management through mobile devices—providing flexibility, ease of use, and powerful control from anywhere in the venue.
